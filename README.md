Rootless works with derootifier but the respring will not work apparently, so you will need another way to respring by yourself, feel free to compile it to rootless yourself to not have to use derootifier if you wish

Big thanks to windi and King Luki for helping me, as this is my first tweak/project!!!

List of supported jailbreaks:
- Checkra1n
- Palera1n
- Dopamine (derootifier)

Unsupported jailbreaks:
- Taurine-kdf (It works but it behaves very weird and causes random respring and enter safe mode for no apparent reason)

Any other jailbreaks that haven't been mentioned could work but are untested.
The build is for ios 14.0 + but if you know what you are doing then you should be able to change it to work on a lower ios version just change the makefile's minimum version.
