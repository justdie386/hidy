NOTE i am never updating this, objective-c is ass

Hide it, why the fuck not?

to build it run: ```make do```
make sure you have theos installed im not sure if it matters but if it ain't working then install it

Here is what it does: Change the carrier label Change the battery percentage label Hide the wifi icon Hide the cellular data icon Hide the time Hide the label under applications Hide the 3 dots on the homescreen Hide the homescreen Hide the dock icons Hide the dock background blur Hide the full dock Hide the notification bubble Hide the full top bar

Works on rootless but requires usage of derootifier, also note that if you install it from bigboss the respring won't work on rootless, i fixed it in here but haven't pushed the fix to the repo

Big thanks to windi and King Luki for helping me, as this is my first tweak/project!!!

It behaves really weird on taurine 14.3+ with kdf (tested on 14.8.1 iphone 7) so yeah you shouldn't use it on that
